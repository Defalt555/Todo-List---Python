# TODO LIST // A simple project 


To Do list is a simple program I developped to pratice my skills and advance them.

## Timeline of the project

### 18/92/2026 
The program finally takes a more structured form, with readme and .gitignore files and all. I start to take it more seriously and plan to make a graphical interface. 



# Who I am ? 
Im a French high school student who loves programming but didn't dive deep into it. I want it to change by actively posting on GitHub and participating as much as possible. Taking experience is my main objective. And my dream job is to be a software engineer.
