# TODO LIST // A simple project 


Todo list is a program I developped to mainly pratice my skills and advance them. It's not a big deal of course, but it's a good start yk. 

## Timeline of the project

### 18/92/2026 
The program finally takes a more structured form, with readme and .gitignore files and all. I start to take it more seriously and plan to make a graphical interface. 



# Who I am ? 
Im a French high school student who loves programming but didn't relly deep dive into it. So I want to be more active by posting on GitHub and participating as much as possible. Taking experience is my main objective for now, because my dream job is to be a software engineer.
